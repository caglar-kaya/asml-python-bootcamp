st.markdown("> The project is divided into four main steps:")

st.markdown("2.1. **Creating Directories:** Code checks and creates two directories, \"Company-A\" and \"Company-B\" if they don't exist already.")

st.markdown("2.2. **Creating and Storing Data for Company-A:** A pandas DataFrame is created with mock employee data. This DataFrame is then exported as an Excel sheet, CSV file and text file in the \"Company-A\" directory.")

st.markdown("2.3. **ETL Process:** Files from \"Company-A\" are read and transformed (sorted based on employee names), then written to the \"Company-B\" directory.")

st.markdown("### 3. Note")

st.markdown("> Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed and ensure the read/write permissions are properly set for the directories before running the script.")
